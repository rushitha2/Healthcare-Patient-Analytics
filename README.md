## Background
MediCare Hospital, a multi-specialty healthcare provider, struggled with high patient readmission rates and inefficient risk assessment for critically ill patients. 
The major challenges included:
-	Delayed identification of high-risk patients, leading to complications.
-	Lack of real-time analytics, making it difficult for doctors to take preventive measures.
-	Manual data tracking, slowing down decision-making and increasing hospital costs.

## The goal was to optimize:
1.	 Patient admission & discharge processes
2.	Early prediction of high-risk cases
3.	Post-discharge monitoring & follow-up care
4.	Overall hospital efficiency & patient satisfaction
